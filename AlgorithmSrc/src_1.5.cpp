1.5 One Away : There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings : 
                  insert a character, 
                  remove a character, 
                  or replace a character.

               Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit(or zero edits) 
               away.
               
               EXAMPLE 
               
               pale, ple -> true 
               pales, pale -> true 
               pale, bale -> true 
               pale, bae -> false
