# TechnicalExercises

There is so many different ways to write software and a big part of that is being able to solve brain teasers and problems.  There is so many books out there to be able to do this.  Many of these books are geared towards coding interviews and writing the code in some very high level langauge like Jave or C# mainly because these languages have so many built-in libraries and non-offensive syntax.

The reason this project was setup is to show solutions to brain teasers, but in C and C++.  I used the following:
* For brain teasers and computer science questions, "Cracking the Conding Interview 6th Edition" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell:
** https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=gayle+laakmann&qid=1566488371&s=gateway&sr=8-1
* For alogrithms specific to C/C++, "Algorithms in C, Parts 1-5 (Bundle): Fundamentals, Data Structures, Sorting, Searching, and Graph Algorithms (3rd Edition) 3rd Edition" by Rodger Sedgewick:
** https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Parts-1-5-Bundle-Fundamentals/dp/0201756080/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=algorithms+c+c%2B%2B&qid=1566488408&s=gateway&sr=8-2
